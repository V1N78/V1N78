Here are some of the things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a profile card
- ðŸŒ± Past digital projects I have created are the Tinkercad Pa site project and the game website I made last year.
- ðŸ‘¯ Some of the digital languages I know and learnt are HTML and CSS.
- ðŸ¤” I want to study digital technology because I love solving problems using logic and whnever I have a bug, the pride and joy from solving that one bug just feels so satisfying.
- âœ¨ In the future, I really want to create a short animation from rendering through blender. I also want to learn how to do it.
